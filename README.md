It's very rare to see ambitious and greedy AI vassals starting a scheme to claim their liege's title. Not because they don't have the right personality, but simply because they haven't unlocked the meritocracy perk and are stuck on their own lifestyle focus.

This mod fixes that: It will ensure that AI vassal characters with the right personality (greedy, ambitious, etc) will focus on a stewardship lifestyle and prioritize picking the meritocracy perk. Once the perk is gained, they will return to their "normal" lifestyle focus.

This makes the game more realistic, and interesting (you will see more internal disputes over claims)
